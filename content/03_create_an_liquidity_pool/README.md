# Creating a pool on Unichain

A trading pool, often called a liquidity pool, is a collection of funds locked in a smart contract that enables trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or other DeFi platforms.

Users known as liquidity providers (LPs) contribute pairs of tokens, such as ETH and a stablecoin like USDC, to the pool. In exchange for their deposits, LPs earn rewards, typically in the form of transaction fees generated from trades executed within the pool.

Unlike traditional exchanges that rely on order books, DEXs with liquidity pools utilize an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model. In this system, the price of tokens in the pool is determined by a mathematical formula based on the ratio of tokens available. As traders swap tokens, the pool automatically adjusts prices according to supply and demand.

Trading pools offer significant benefits for traders by providing instant liquidity, allowing them to execute trades without waiting for a counterparty. This is especially useful in a decentralized environment, where users prefer to trade directly from their wallets without depending on a centralized authority.

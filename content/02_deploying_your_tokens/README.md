# Creating your token pairs

In a Uniswap liquidity pool, the two tokens are commonly referred to as a **trading pair**. Each pair consists of a **base token** and a **quote token**.

### Base Token

The **base token** is the primary asset users want to buy or sell. For instance, in the ETH/USDC pair, ETH serves as the base token. This token is often the focal point of trading activity in the pool.

### Quote Token

On the other hand, the **quote token** is used to price the base token. In the ETH/USDC example, USDC is the quote token, representing the value of ETH in a stable currency. This setup enables users to swap one token for another based on current market rates, providing liquidity and facilitating trades within the pool.
